      BIND 9.15 is an unstable development release of BIND.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
      have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
      leading up to the stable BIND 9.16 release, this document will be
      updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="relnotes_versions"><info><title>Note on Version Numbering</title></info>
    <para>
      Until BIND 9.12, new feature development releases were tagged
      as "alpha" and "beta", leading up to the first stable release
      for a given development branch, which always ended in ".0".
      More recently, BIND adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
      release numbering convention. There will be no "alpha" or "beta"
      releases in the 9.15 branch, only increasing version numbers.
      So, for example, what would previously have been called 9.15.0a1,
      9.15.0a2, 9.15.0b1, and so on, will instead be called 9.15.0,
      9.15.1, 9.15.2, etc.
    </para>
    <para>
      The first stable release from this development branch will be
      renamed as 9.16.0. Thereafter, maintenance releases will continue
      on the 9.16 branch, while unstable feature development proceeds in
      9.17.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="relnotes_platforms"><info><title>Supported Platforms</title></info>
    <para>
      To build on UNIX-like systems, BIND requires support for POSIX.1c
      threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
      IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
      C compiler.
    </para>
    <para>
      The OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
      platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead for Public Key
      cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation), but OpenSSL is
      still required for general cryptography operations such as hashing
      and random number generation.
    </para>
    <para>
      More information can be found in the <filename>PLATFORMS.md</filename>
      file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
      compiler and system libraries provide the above features, BIND 9
      should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
      development team will generally accept patches that add support
      for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
    </para>

	  The GeoIP2 API from MaxMind is now supported. Geolocation support
	  will be compiled in by default if the <command>libmaxminddb</command>
	  library is found at compile time, but can be turned off by using
	  <command>configure --without-geoip2</command>, or by using
	  <command>configure --with-geoip</command>, which will cause
	  the legacy GeoIP API to be used instead.  (Note that the
	  databases for the legacy API are no longer maintained by
	  MaxMind.)
	</para>
	<para>
	  The default path to the GeoIP2 databases will be set based
	  on the location of the <command>libmaxminddb</command> library;
	  for example, if it is in <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>,
	  then the default path will be
	  <filename>/usr/local/share/GeoIP</filename>.
	  This value can be overridden in <filename>named.conf</filename>
	  using the <command>geoip-directory</command> option.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Some <command>geoip</command> ACL settings that were available with
	  legacy GeoIP, including searches for <command>netspeed</command>,
	  <command>org</command>, and three-letter ISO country codes, will
	  no longer work when using GeoIP2. Supported GeoIP2 database
	  types are <command>country</command>, <command>city</command>,
	  <command>domain</command>, <command>isp</command>, and
	  <command>as</command>. All of these databases support both IPv4
	  and IPv6 lookups. [GL #182]

	  In order to clarify the configuration of DNSSEC keys,

	  deprecated, and the new <command>dnssec-keys</command>
	  statement should now be used for both types of key.
	</para>
	<para>
	  When used with the keyword <command>initial-key</command>,
	  <command>dnssec-keys</command> has the same behavior as
	  <command>managed-keys</command>, i.e., it configures
	  a trust anchor that is to be maintained via RFC 5011.
	</para>
	<para>
	  When used with the new keyword <command>static-key</command>, it
	  has the same behavior as <command>trusted-keys</command>,

	  Two new metrics have been added to the

	  signing operations.  For each key in each zone, the
	  <command>dnssec-sign</command> counter indicates the total
	  number of signatures <command>named</command> has generated
	  using that key since server startup, and the
	  <command>dnssec-refresh</command> counter indicates how
	  many of those signatures were refreshed during zone
	  maintenance, as opposed to having been generated
	  as a result of a zone update.  [GL #513]

	  value of <literal>auto</literal>, automatic RFC 5011 key
	  rollovers would be disabled. This combination of settings was

	  installation path as an optional argument.
