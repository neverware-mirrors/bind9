          In this release, the build system has been significantly changed (see
          below), and there's number of unresolved issues that you need to be
          aware of if you are using a development release.  Please refer to
          GitLab issue #4 https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9/-/issues/4
          for a list of not yet resolved issues that will be fixed in the
          following releases.

          The BIND 9 build system has been changed to use the normal build tool
          stack consisting of autoconf+automake+libtool.  This should not make
          any difference for people building BIND 9 from the release tarballs,
          but if you are building BIND 9 from the git repository, or you are
          using non-standard <command>./configure</command> option, you will
          need to pay extra attention. [GL #4]

          The default rwlock implementation has been changed back to the native
          BIND 9 rwlock implementation. [GL #1753]

	<para>
	  When transferring zones of type <command>mirror</command>, use AXFR
	  unless specifically configured to request IXFR at the zone level.
	  This avoids an inefficiency: IXFRs sometimes consist of more than
	  one transaction, and the entire zone is revalidated after each
	  transaction. Mirror zones are usually only used for the root
	  zone, which is infrequently updated and not very large, so
	  AXFR by default makes sense. [GL #1803]

          When running on a system with Linux capabilities support,
          <command>named</command> drops root privileges very soon after system
          startup. This was causing a spurious log message, <quote>unable to set
          effective uid to 0: Operation not permitted</quote>, which has now been
          silenced. [GL #1042] [GL #1090]
