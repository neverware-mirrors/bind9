Notes for BIND 9.17.3
---------------------

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New ``rndc`` command ``rndc dnssec -status`` that shows the current
  DNSSEC policy and keys in use, the key states and rollover status.
  [GL #1612]

- Disable and disallow static linking of BIND 9 binaries and libraries
  as BIND 9 modules require ``dlopen()`` support and static linking also
  prevents using security features like read-only relocations (RELRO) or
  address space layout randomization (ASLR) which are important for
  programs that interact with the network and process arbitrary user
  input. [GL #1933]

- As part of an ongoing effort to use RFC 8499 terminology, ``primaries``
  can now be used as a synonym for ``masters`` in ``named.conf``.
  Similarly, ``notify priamry-only`` can now be used as a synonym
  for ``notify master-only``. The output of ``rndc zonestatus`` now
  uses ``primary`` and ``secondary`` terminology. [GL #1948]

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The DS set returned by ``dns_keynode_dsset()`` was not thread-safe.
  This could result in an INSIST being triggered. [GL #1926]

- The ``primary`` and ``secondary`` keywords, when used as parameters for
  ``check-names``, were not processed correctly and were being ignored.
  [GL #1949]

- 'rndc dnstap -roll <value>' was not limiting the number of saved
  files to <value>. [GL !3728]

- The validator could fail to accept a properly signed RRset if an
  unsupported algorithm appeared earlier in the DNSKEY RRset than a
  supported algorithm.  It could also stop if it detected a malformed
  public key. [GL #1689]

- The ``blackhole`` ACL was inadvertently disabled with respect to
  client queries. Blocked IP addresses were not used for upstream
  queries but queries from those addresses could still be answered.
  [GL #1936]

- ``named`` would crash on shutdown when new ``rndc`` connection is received at
  the same time as shutting down. [GL #1747]

- Fix assertion failure when server is under load and root zone is not yet
  loaded. [GL #1862]

- ``named`` could crash when cleaning dead nodes in ``lib/dns/rbtdb.c`` that
  have been reused meanwhile.  [GL #1968]
