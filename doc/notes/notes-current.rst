Notes for BIND 9.17.8
---------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``dig`` can now report the DNS64 prefixes in use (``+dns64prefix``).
  This is useful when the host on which ``dig`` is run is behind an
  IPv6-only link, using DNS64/NAT64 or 464XLAT for IPv4aaS (IPv4 as a
  Service). [GL #1154]

- A new configuration option ``require-cookie`` has been introduced, it
  specifies if there should be a DNS COOKIE in the response for a given
  prefix and if not named falls back to TCP.  This is useful if you know
  a given server support DNS COOKIE.  It can also be used to force all
  non DNS COOKIE responses to fall back to TCP.  [GL #2295]

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add NSEC3 support for zones that manage their DNSSEC with the `dnssec-policy`
  configuration. A new option 'nsec3param' can be used to set the desired
  NSEC3 parameters, and will detect collisions when resalting. [GL #1620].

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The synthesised CNAME from a DNAME was incorrectly followed when the QTYPE
  was CNAME or ANY. [GL #2280]

- Tighten handling of missing DNS COOKIE responses over UDP by
  falling back to TCP. [GL #2275]
