Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The new networking code introduced in BIND 9.16 (netmgr) was
  overhauled in order to make it more stable, testable, and
  maintainable. [GL #2321]

- Earlier releases of BIND versions 9.16 and newer required the
  operating system to support load-balanced sockets in order for
  ``named`` to be able to achieve high performance (by distributing
  incoming queries among multiple threads). However, the only operating
  systems currently known to support load-balanced sockets are Linux and
  FreeBSD 12, which means both UDP and TCP performance were limited to a
  single thread on other systems. As of BIND 9.17.8, ``named`` attempts
  to distribute incoming queries among multiple threads on systems which
  lack support for load-balanced sockets (except Windows). [GL #2137]
