Notes for BIND 9.17.8
---------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``named`` daemon uses load-balanced sockets to increase performance by
  distributing the incoming queries among multiple threads.  Currently, the only
  operating systems that support load-balanced sockets are Linux and FreeBSD 12,
  thus both UDP and TCP performance is limited to a single-thread on systems
  without load-balancing socket support. [GL #2137]

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``dig`` can now report the DNS64 prefixes in use (``+dns64prefix``).
  This is useful when the host on which ``dig`` is run is behind an
  IPv6-only link, using DNS64/NAT64 or 464XLAT for IPv4aaS (IPv4 as a
  Service). [GL #1154]

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add NSEC3 support for zones that manage their DNSSEC with the `dnssec-policy`
  configuration. A new option 'nsec3param' can be used to set the desired
  NSEC3 parameters, and will detect collisions when resalting. [GL #1620].

- Enable users to go back to insecure mode without going bogus. Changing
  to 'dnssec-policy none;' will also publish CDS and CDNSKEY DELETE to signal
  that the entire DS RRset at the parent must be removed, as described in
  RFC 8078. [GL #1750].

- Adjust the ``max-recursion-queries`` default from 75 to 100. Since the
  queries sent towards root and TLD servers are now included in the
  count (as a result of the fix for CVE-2020-8616), ``max-recursion-queries``
  has a higher chance of being exceeded by non-attack queries, which is the
  main reason for increasing its default value. [GL #2305]

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The synthesised CNAME from a DNAME was incorrectly followed when the QTYPE
  was CNAME or ANY. [GL #2280]

- Tighten handling of missing DNS COOKIE responses over UDP by
  falling back to TCP. [GL #2275]

- Building with native PKCS#11 support for AEP Keyper has been broken
  since BIND 9.17.4. This has been fixed. [GL #2315]
